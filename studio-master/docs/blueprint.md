# **App Name**: Blockly Builder

## Core Features:

- Blockly Workspace: Drag and drop interface using Google Blockly to create visual code blocks.
- Code Preview: Code preview: Dynamically display the equivalent Javascript code in a separate window.
- AI Code Generation: Generate Javascript based on user intent. The AI will function as a tool and choose to incorporate commonly-used control flow patterns, depending on its reasoning about the prompt.
- Project Management: Save and load Blockly projects to local storage.
- Code Export: Export the generated Javascript code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5D9CEC) for a sense of logic and clarity.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EAF2FA), almost white, for a clean coding environment.
- Accent color: Light green (#90EE90) to highlight active elements and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean, modern, and readable UI.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for clear distinction of the generated Javascript code.
- Use flat, geometric icons to match the blocky, visual nature of Blockly.
- Split-screen layout with Blockly workspace on one side and the code preview on the other.
